This application randomly select an item from a list of inputted choices.

This application uses a string, a string vector, and a while loop to perform its function. The string is used to temporary store the response from the user. The string vector is used to store all the inputs from the user. The while loop is used to continuously prompt the user for an input.

When the application executes, the user is prompted to enter their first choice, then the while loop is entered where the user is continuously prompted for more inputs until "fin" is inputted. Once the loop exits, the program uses the rand function to select one of the inputs, and then display the result.
